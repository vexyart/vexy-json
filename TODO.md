## Future Development (Post-Release)

**Note**: The items below are substantial feature development projects for future major releases (v1.6+), not bug fixes. Each would require significant architecture work and implementation time.

### Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Complete the pattern-based error recovery system (currently stubbed)
- [ ] Implement the ML-based pattern recognition
- [ ] Finish the streaming parser implementation
- [ ] Optimize memory pool usage

### Performance Enhancements

- [ ] Remove dead code to reduce binary size
- [ ] Optimize hot paths identified by warnings
- [ ] Implement SIMD optimizations where applicable

### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Add integration tests for all language bindings
- [ ] Create property-based tests for edge cases
- [ ] Set up continuous fuzzing

### Plugin System

- [ ] Design and implement a plugin architecture
- [ ] Create example plugins
- [ ] Document plugin development

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Incremental parsing for live editing
- [ ] Schema validation integration
- [ ] Advanced error recovery strategies
- [ ] JSON path query support
