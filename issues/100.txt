- Now /work on items from @TODO.md consulting on @PLAN.md
- If needed read the @llms.txt code snapshot
- Review reflect refine revise, and then continue to /work on @PLAN.md and @TODO.md - until every single item and issue has been fixed
- Iterate iterate iterate! 
- Do not stop, do not ask for confirmation. Work! 
- When you're finishing one task or item, say "Wait, but..." and go on to the next - task/item
- Itâ€™s CRUCIAL that we get to a solution that BUILDS everything correctly! 
- Then /report and mark completed items as done in @PLAN.md and @TODO.md
- Then run `./build.sh` and then check the build logs
- Ensure that we build a single-file CLI tool, which works without any external dependencies, and also ensure that our build process produces deliverables for each platform in appropriate subfolders of @dist (`macos`, `windows`, `linux`) and in there we have not only the plain deliverable but also: (1) For macOS a .dmg that contains the .pkg which installs the CLI into /usr/local/bin (2) For Windows a .zip containing the CLI .exe (3) for Linux a .tgz containing the CLI executable
