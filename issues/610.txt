Read the @llms.txt codebase snapshot. Note: recently we have renamed the project from `ZZSON` to `Vexy JSON`. We have search-replaced many strings like `zzson` to `vexy_json`, but mistakes may have been made. Please review all files, check if the changes have been performed consistently. . Run build scripts. Then into @PLAN.md write a detailed plan to improve and fix the code, and then into @TODO.md write a linearized version of that. Then /work on it.
