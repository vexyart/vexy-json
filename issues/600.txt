When I do `./release.sh 2.0.8`, I want the release script to: 

- actually add/commit everything to git
- git-tag with semver like `v2.0.8` 
- as much as possible cause all versioning everywhere to be based on the git-tag-semver 
- build, locally build deliverables (nicely named, placed in 'dist')
- git-push 
- do "everything" (as much as possible, as cleanly as possible, and also as ROBUSTLY as possible)
