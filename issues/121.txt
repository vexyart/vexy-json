Run 

```
./build.sh;gitnextver;./release.sh >release.log.txt 2>release.err.txt
```

Then analyze the files: build.log.txt build.err.txt release.log.txt release.err.txt 

And then into @PLAN.md write a detailed plan on how to fix the problems and then into @TODO.md write a linearized content of that. 

And then implement all changes detailed in @TODO.md and @PLAN.md
