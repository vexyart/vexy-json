Read @grep.txt (the result of running `rg -C 3 "vexy" > grep.txt`) to see a list of occurrences of the phrase `vexy`. Our project is called "Vexy JSON". Review where we should use `Vexy JSON` and were `VEXYJSON` and where `vexy_json` and where `vexy-json` etc. Then into @TODO.md write a VERY DETAILED plan that will discuss in which occurrences we should keep the current spelling, and in which occurrences we need to change it and how.
