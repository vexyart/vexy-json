Analyze the codebase ( @llms.txt is the snapshot ) and especially analyze the Github Pages website in @docs 

In @docs we have @docs/tool.html

1. We want that page to share navigation with the remaining Jekyll site, somehow. 
2. More importantly, we want a "sister web page" with the identical design which will allow the end-user to use the `jsonic` library (analogous to our `vexy_json` in @docs/tool.html)

Into @PLAN.md develop a very detailed and specific plan for the above. 

The pages should have identical designs, and should use DaisyUI with design compatible to the rest of the website (which is Jekyll with `just-the-docs` theme )
