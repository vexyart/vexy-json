Take @RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md and incorporate the information into all @docs and @README.md. Then write a complete set of build & release scripts for various platforms, and incorporate a complete set of Github actions to produce a solid 2.0.0 Gitub release with extensive deliverables. The CLI needs to be built and delivered for macOS and Windows and Linux. The macOS deliverable should be two-fold: a simple ZIP and a .dmg containing a .pkg that installs the CLI into /usr/local/bin â€” Follow industry standards and best practices to structure the repo for the release, and implement all components so I can just type ./release.sh and have it all happen (and it should also happen on Github semver git-tagging of v2.0.0)
