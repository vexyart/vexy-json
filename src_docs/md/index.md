# Vexy JSON Documentation

## TLDR

**Vexy JSON** is a forgiving JSON parser built in Rust that extends standard JSON with developer-friendly features while maintaining high performance and full compatibility with existing JSON. Unlike strict parsers, Vexy JSON accepts trailing commas, comments, unquoted keys, and more - making configuration files and development workflows smoother.

**Key Features:**
- üöÄ **High Performance**: Blazing fast parsing with zero-copy optimizations
- üõ°Ô∏è **Forgiving**: Accepts non-standard but commonly used JSON extensions
- üåê **Multi-Language**: Rust native with Python, JavaScript/WASM, and C/C++ bindings
- üîß **Developer Friendly**: Detailed error messages with repair suggestions
- üì¶ **Production Ready**: Battle-tested with comprehensive test suite

## Quick Example

```rust
use vexy_json::VexyJson;

// Parse forgiving JSON with comments and trailing commas
let json = r#"
{
    "name": "Vexy JSON", // This is a comment
    "features": [
        "fast",
        "forgiving",
        "multi-language", // Trailing comma is OK
    ],
    unquoted_key: "also works",
}
"#;

let parsed = VexyJson::parse(json)?;
println!("{:?}", parsed);
```
