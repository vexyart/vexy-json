# Vexy JSON Development Plan - Future Enhancements

## Current Status: v1.5.6 - Stable Release

All critical issues from previous releases have been resolved. The project is in excellent condition with:
- 200/200 tests passing
- All clippy errors fixed (0 warnings remaining)
- Build system stable with fuzzing properly handled
- Version management automated
- C API has comprehensive safety documentation
- All immediate and high-priority items completed

## Future Development Roadmap (v1.6+)

### Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Complete the pattern-based error recovery system (currently stubbed)
- [ ] Implement the ML-based pattern recognition
- [ ] Finish the streaming parser implementation
- [ ] Optimize memory pool usage

### Performance Enhancements

- [ ] Remove dead code to reduce binary size
- [ ] Optimize hot paths identified by warnings
- [ ] Implement SIMD optimizations where applicable

### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Add integration tests for all language bindings
- [ ] Create property-based tests for edge cases
- [ ] Set up continuous fuzzing

### Plugin System

- [ ] Design and implement a plugin architecture
- [ ] Create example plugins
- [ ] Document plugin development

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Incremental parsing for live editing
- [ ] Schema validation integration
- [ ] Advanced error recovery strategies
- [ ] JSON path query support

## Implementation Strategy

These features represent substantial architectural improvements and new capabilities that would be implemented in future major releases (v1.6+). Each requires significant design work and implementation time, making them roadmap items rather than immediate fixes.

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Fuzzing works or is properly disabled (currently deferred)
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Release script validates test success
- [x] Ready for clean releases
