## âš¡ Performance Issue

**Describe the performance problem**
A clear and concise description of the performance issue you're experiencing.

**Performance Impact**
- [ ] Slow parsing (takes more than expected time)
- [ ] High memory usage
- [ ] Browser freezing/unresponsive
- [ ] Large bundle size
- [ ] Slow loading times

**Input Characteristics**
Please describe the input that causes the performance issue:
- **Input size**: [e.g. 1MB, 10MB, 100KB]
- **Input structure**: [e.g. deeply nested objects, large arrays, many comments]
- **Input complexity**: [e.g. simple flat object, complex nested structure]

**Sample Input** (if possible)
If you can share a sample of the problematic input (anonymized if needed):
```json
{
  "sample": "input that causes performance issues"
}
```

**Performance Measurements**
If you have measurements, please share them:
- **Parse time**: [e.g. 5 seconds, 30 seconds]
- **Memory usage**: [e.g. 500MB, 2GB]
- **Browser**: [e.g. Chrome 120 on macOS]

**Expected Performance**
What performance would you expect for this input?
- **Expected parse time**: [e.g. under 1 second]
- **Expected memory usage**: [e.g. under 100MB]
